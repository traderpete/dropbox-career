-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I am considered a technical leader on my team. I autonomously engage with product and system owners across Dropbox to help create, build, and innovate security defenses. I have an in-depth knowledge of Security and possess a comprehensive view of how the Dropbox environment and services fit together. I focus on large and ambiguous security problems across internal and partner organizations. I take a long-term view and understand the details about my team’s security services and processes. I drive and plan the Security of large, complex, cross-team projects/incidents that could span multiple quarters and often involve numerous security members. I mentor, teach, and influence other members of Security continuously \- the scope of my impact is amplified through their successes. My understanding of the business context and organization priorities enables me to deliver in alignment with longer-term security needs, not just immediate requirements.

| **Responsibility** | **Key Behaviors** |
| **Security** **Execution** | * My work demonstrates significant domain expertise in three or more security domains and secondary specializations,  (e.g. infrastructure security, application security, threat intelligence, security operations, incident response, endpoint security, or identity management).  I understand the latest defensive capabilities provided by each layer of the stack in my purview and understand when to deploy them.<br><br>* I have extensive experience with multiple methods of assessment, and can make the right call to identify the best approach for a given problem.<br><br>* I  design and/or implement structural changes to enforce security requirements and defenses at the scope of an entire product/codebase  (e.g. Paper, Hellosign, or rSERVER)<br><br>* I define and implement a comprehensive strategy to address a security problem, drawing upon a mixture of the necessary first-party, open source, or off-the-shelf technologies to enforce security requirements, detect badness, or defend Dropbox.<br><br>* I consistently identify and provide solutions for non-obvious issues in the design, implementation, operation, and evaluation of security processes and technologies.<br><br>* I own the response to complex security incidents, or drive strategic remediation initiatives which involve many teams/organizations/systems across Dropbox.<br><br>* I track incidents, vulnerabilities, and other security trends over time and effectively incorporate lessons learned into Security strategy and requirements.<br><br>* I effectively partner across the company to define and implement security requirements within a scope spanning several different layers of an infrastructure stack, disparate teams across several organizations, or parallel workstreams of a large scale initiative. |
| **Technology Fluency** | * I apply a comprehensive understanding of the Dropbox technology stack and relevant external technologies within my focus. I both maintain awareness and ensure my organization is aware of changes as they occur.I influence the design and architecture choices made by partner-orgs  (e.g., system, network, or software).<br><br>* I understand that technology, threats, and responses evolve and use that evolution to identify opportunities to improve security controls accordingly. |
| **Threat Fluency** | * I have a deep understanding of attacker tools, techniques, and processes  (TTPs) and the standard defenses/mitigations for them.<br><br>* I am broadly aware of the kinds of defenses and their efficacy at mitigating attacks relevant to Dropbox Security.<br><br>* I am continuously tracking and learning about attacks/attackers both inside and outside of my focus area<br><br>* I am familiar with historical attacks of consequence and the lessons learned from them.<br><br>* I am able to reason about attacker behavior and apply my understanding of TTPs in support of the rest of my job. |
